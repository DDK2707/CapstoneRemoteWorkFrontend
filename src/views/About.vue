        <h1>About TUNEz</h1> <br>
        <p>My name is Dale, and I've been obsessed with music for as long as I can remember. It became an outlet for me at a very young age 
          and now I would say that I have a passion, both for appreciating music and creating it. </p><br>
        <p>I am dedicated to music, both as a craft worthy of recognition and as an outlet for those who need it.
          I was inspired to create TUNEz to remove a musician's panic when looking for a producer or record label, and to expedite the process of producers and labels
          searching for new talent.
